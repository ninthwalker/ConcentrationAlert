# CONCENTRATION ALERT SAMPLE SETTINGS AND DESCRIPTIONS
# Use this for reference, but put your actual settings in the main concentration_alert_standalone_settings.txt file, not this one!
# A couple Notes:
# 1. Do not modify the section headers or anything before the equals (=) sign.
# 2. No Quotes or anything is needed around your settings. Just put it verbatim.
# 3. See Examples and if you have any questions, pop in the Discord Server here: https://discord.com/invite/gjjA8M8KX8
# 4. Make sure you also read the main instructions on the github site, as you also need the Addon that goes along with this.
# 5. Reminder, don't actually use this file, put your settings in the one called: wow_concentration_alert_standalone_settings.txt

[REALM SETTINGS]
# Enter the full path to the ConcentrationAlert.lua file on your computer
# normally under: ..\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT_NAME>\SavedVariables\ConcentrationAlert.lua
AddonLuaPath  = C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT_NAME>\SavedVariables\ConcentrationAlert.lua

# Enter in the realm name(s) to check. Add more with a comma separating the server names. No spaces. ie: Tichondrius,Area 52,etc
RealmNames = Tichondius

# Enter in the character name(s) to check for cooldowns
# Only enter each character name once. ie: if you have a character named 'Joe' on realm1 and realm2 to check, only list 'Joe' once below.
# ie for one char: Batman
# For multiple char's, separate them with a comma. No Spaces. ie: Batman,Superman,ImAnAltaholic
# Alternatively, if you want to alert on all characters on all realms, enter in the word 'all' instead of specific character names
CharNames  = Batman,Superman

[DISCORD SETTINGS]
# Discordwebhook. Set up your own discord server and channel and create a webhook for it.
DiscordWebhook = https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your webhook here

[ALERT SETTINGS]
# Enter time (in minutes) for how far before your concentration is full to start alerting you.
# defailt is to alert 3 hrs before your concentration is full (180 min)
AlertTime     = 180

# how often do you want to keep being alerted? Setting this to True will keep alerting you every 'intervalTime'.
# (in minutes, lowest value is 10, and maximum would be the 'alertTime' you set above)
# ie: if 'alertTime' is set to 180 (3hrs) and you set this to 60 (1hr), you would receive an alert 3hrs before, then every hour after.
# set interval to True to enable or False to only alert once when the 'alertTime' is met. Default is False
Interval      = False
IntervalTime  = 60

# Continous alerting. Set 'keepBuggingMe' to True if you want an alert every set 'intervalTime' even after your concentration is full.
Will keep bugging you for each interval up to one day after concentration is full.
# this requires that interval is set above to True. Default is False
KeepBuggingMe = False
